    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok's rise :</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>May 7, 1996</strong> - Born in Seoul, South Korea </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2011</strong> - Discovers a new game called League of Legends and instantly becomes very good at the game.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2013</strong> - Joins a Proffesional League of Legends team call SK Telecom T1 or SKT for short. That same year, SKT became regional champions in Korea and ultimately Worlds Champion on the back of Faker.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2015</strong> - After failing to win a regional championship in 2014, SKT had drafted a new roster, only keeping Faker from the original line up. They again won Regionals and Worlds Championship with this new and improved line up of players. They are the first and only team even now to ever win two Worlds Championships.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2016</strong> - With most of the other regions and other teams in their region slowly catching up to SKT and their level of skill, SKT had a rough season of League of Legends. They did not win their regional championship but still qualified for Worlds Championship Tournament. This time, they barely won Worlds with thier semi final and final matches being very close. SKT led by Faker is now a three time Worlds Champion and the only team to ever win bakc to back Worlds.
